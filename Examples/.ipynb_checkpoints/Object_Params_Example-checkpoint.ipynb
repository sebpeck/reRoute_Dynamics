    "However, there is one last variable that's a bit trickier to source. Most busses have an integrated speed regulator that keeps the bus adherent to a particular acceleration profile. These can vary significantly, but for us to actually generate a bus that can interact with the rest of the modules in this package, we need one. To this end, Object_Params.py has some tools to create one if you don't have raw t vs a (in units of g's) data. From investigating NREL's listing for the [Braunscheig drive cycle](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/drive-cycle-tool/ ), I derived the equation used in Object_Params.a_eqn()."

    "- sign_rest (t_sign): the time, in seconds, the bus stops at a stop sign.\n",

    "- air_density (p_air): the density of air, in SI units.\n",
    "- wind_speed (v_wind): the windspeed, in SI units.\n",
    "- wind_heading (wind_bearing): the compass direction, as a string, that the wind is travelling from.\n",
