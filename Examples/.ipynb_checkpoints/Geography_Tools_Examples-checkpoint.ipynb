    "# Geography_Tools Examples\n",
    "This notebook will give you a quick rundown of the methods and tools used in Geography_Tools.py. There are a good number, but most are relatively uncomplicated. To get ourselves started, we're going to need some bits of geospatial data. For the purposes of our demonstration, I'll provide a series of geospatial coordinates that follow a particular stretch of road in Redmond, Washington. Normally, however, you will probably want to use a shapefile. Fortunately, there's already plenty of documentation out on the web to figure that part out. And if there isn't, well... I'd reckon there are bigger issues afoot. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Raster elevation files can be downloaded from [The Washington Lidar Portal](https://lidarportal.dnr.wa.gov/#47.63636:-122.11905:13). Specifically, for this example I am using Redmond 2014's DTM (digital terrain model), which represents the tree-less and building-less topography of a landscape.\n",
