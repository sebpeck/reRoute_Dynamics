For the sake of Microsoft not coming to my doorstep with a 15th century Cannon for
singlehandedly melting a server rack with this data, I have not included any of the
actual .tif files here. They can be found as King County West 2021 at the following URL:
https://lidarportal.dnr.wa.gov/#47.56263:-122.73926:10

Please use at your hard drive's own rist. the DTM files just for the west side of king county are 87.5 GB, and to
reproject them with Geography_Tools, it saves reprojected versions. So, make sure to have double the space of whatever rasters you're looking at.

Good Luck!
